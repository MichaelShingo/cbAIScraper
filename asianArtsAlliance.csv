Director of Development - Shelburne Museum ,None,,"Shelburne Museum is a nationally significant institution that is intellectually vibrant, financially sustainable, and committed to its Vermont community through the stewardship and interpretation of a unique campus and renowned collections. It seeks to provide visitors with stimulating experiences reflecting the highest standards of scholarship and the intelligence, whimsy, and courage of its founder, Electra Havemeyer Webb (1888-1960) who described the museum as “an educational project, varied and alive.”

Shelburne Museum was founded in 1947 by Mrs. Webb who was among a small group of collectors who helped define what we now know as American Folk Art, and created an institution designed to engage and delight. The museum’s 39 buildings house collections of more than 100,000 paintings, textiles, decoys, and decorative art objects. The buildings themselves form a collection of 19th-century New England architecture set in an intentional landscape of paths, ponds, specimen trees, and eighteen enchanting gardens. Unlike any other museum, Shelburne is a village of immersive experiences, attracting visitors from all over the world. Since 2011, the John Wilmerding Director of Shelburne Museum, Thomas Denenberg, has further expanded Mrs. Webb’s vision for the museum, enhancing exhibitions and cultural offerings, upgrading the museum’s facilities, connecting with new supporters and partners, and attracting a mission-aligned and engaged board of trustees. In recent years, Shelburne Museum has become a world class institution of increasing sophistication and relevance. 

Shelburne Museum features an engaging program of rotating exhibitions and online educational offerings. Recent exhibitions have included: Luigi Lucioni: Modern Light; Object/s of Play: The Work of Cas Holman and Karen Hewitt; Pop Up: Inflated Sculpture; Pet Friendly: The Art of Stephen Huneck; and Built from the Earth: Pueblo Pottery from the Anthony and Teressa Perry Collection. Online exhibitions include In Plain Sight: Rediscovering Charles Sumner Bunn’s Shorebird Decoys; Mary Cassatt’s Impressions: Assembling the Havemeyer Art Collection; and more. Educational programming includes gallery talks, drop-in art activities, family days, and lectures.

Ensuring the enduring vitality of Shelburne Museum, the museum’s 75th Anniversary campaign is targeting new levels of endowment and capital project support with a goal of $35 million. A major initiative of the campaign, announced in May 2023, includes stewardship of a Native American art collection and construction of a building and integrated landscape collaboratively designed as a national resource for the study and care of Indigenous art. “The initiative will reimagine the Museum’s role in presenting American art and material culture,” announced Director Thomas Denenberg. “With an abiding awareness of the responsibility inherent in caring for a collection that represents living cultures…the Museum has worked to build relationships that will make the Perry Center for Native American Art a national resource for the study and care of Indigenous art.” Among those consulted was the leadership of the four bands of state-recognized Abenaki Tribe, including Don Stevens, Chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk - Abenaki Nation, who served on the National Advisory Committee and who praised the museum’s collaborations with Indigenous communities.

The Perry Center for Native American Art will be designed by internationally acclaimed Adjaye Associates and will be the 40th building on Shelburne Museum’s 45-acre campus. The Perry Center will house a significant collection of Native American art gathered by Anthony and Teressa Perry and gifted to the museum. When combined with the Indigenous art already stewarded by the museum, the collection will represent nearly 80 Tribes from coast to coast. 

Shelburne Museum is governed by a 21-member Board of Trustees led by Chair D. Scott Wise and Director and CEO Thomas Denenberg leads a staff of 75 year-round employees with an equal number of seasonal hires. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, Shelburne Museum reported total revenue of $6,000,193, with $2,929,396 in contributions and grants, $1,507,252 from program services and earned revenue, and $1,467,500 from investment income. Total expenses of $6,378,517 million.

Community

Vermont is a socially, culturally, and environmentally progressive state that is home to some of the country’s most beautiful natural settings. Located at the westernmost edge of the New England region, Vermont’s population is about 625,000 and is made up of small vibrant cities and quaint towns, all offering their own distinct environment with a common throughline of community, civic pride, and creativity. With a unique and dynamic culture, Vermont is consistently ranked one of the safest places to live, one of the best states to live in and to raise a family, and one of the healthiest states in America. The educational system is highly ranked, and the strong transportation infrastructure makes even the most rural areas accessible. Governor Phil Scott and the Department of Economic Development, alongside the Vermont Professionals of Color Network, announced in May 2023 a new partnership to provide technical assistance and development services to Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color business owners and professionals statewide.

With a long tradition of respect for the land, Vermont is the most environmentally conscious state in the country and is a leader in self-sufficient living. Shelburne Museum has recently commissioned two solar arrays, generating 650kw of electricity for the campus and community. Vermonters are serious about outdoor recreation and the state offers everything from skiing and hiking to cycling and sailing. There is a thriving culinary scene featuring innovative local food systems, inventive farm-to-table offerings, artisan cheesemakers, and the most craft breweries per capita in the United States. The state is well-known for its number of living and working artists and for its commitment to the creative economy. A 2019 study showed that 9.3% of Vermont jobs—more than 40,000—are in the creative sector, defined as design, specialty foods, visual arts and fine crafts, performing arts, film and media, literary arts, and culture and heritage. 

Located along the shores of Lake Champlain, Shelburne is south of the city of Burlington, the largest city in the state of Vermont. With a population of 7,717, Shelburne records the highest median income in the Burlington metropolitan area and Chittenden County. The most popular local tourist attractions in addition to the museum include Shelburne Farms, Shelburne Orchards, Shelburne Vineyards, and the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory.

Executive Director,21/07/2023 23:59,,"WE ARE

Hi, we’re the Northwest Center (NWC). We’re a community-based organization rooted in and serving Belmont Cragin and the greater Northwest side of Chicago.

At the NWC, there’s a thread that brings together everything we do. It’s about human connection. Connecting folks to the right people, the right resources, the right skills, in the form of a listening ear, a helping hand, or a warm hug. We’re about cultivating and sustaining an environment of empowerment, inclusivity, justice, and equity where residents can build their neighborhood into home. 

As we say to community members, it’s your neighborhood. Your street. Your family. Your home. And we are here to help ensure that it stays that way. Because at the end of the day, that connecting thread leads right back to you. 

VALUES

Resident-led | Community residents are at the forefront of our work, and our team, from our board to our staff, reflects the community. 

Relational | Strong relationships advance and enhance our work. 

Responsive | We were born out of, and continue to be responsive to, the needs of the community.

Innovative | Innovative programs and organizing campaigns drive our work and differentiate us from others. 

Data-driven | We use data from the community to plan and inform all our work. 

Racially Equitable | Our work seeks to reduce racial inequity through building the power of residents who, as a result of systemic oppression and racism, face pressing issues

CULTURE

At the NWC, you will work with a team of collaborative, thoughtful, trauma-informed, and racial justice-oriented people. You’ll be part of a team that values equity and consensus-based decision making. 

Our office is like a home where guests are always greeted and called by their name, and offered a warm cup of coffee. Our workspace bustles with our team, participants, and community members; youth, parents, older adults. And our people understand that it takes a unified team committed to our values to carry out our work. Our audience is often composed of people who we’re meeting during times of hardship and change. So when we greet folks, pick up the phones, or help a colleague out with refilling the printer paper, we do so with compassion and empathy. Y lo hacemos juntos.

The Saint Louis Art Museum (SLAM) collects, presents, interprets, and conserves works of art of the highest quality across time and cultures; educates, inspires discovery, and elevates the human spirit; preserves a legacy of artistic achievement for the people of St. Louis and the world; and engages the full diversity of the St. Louis community. A public museum generously supported by both taxpayers and donors, SLAM is open free to the public six days per week, including Friday evenings until 9 P.M. 

SLAM was founded in 1879 with a collection that included assorted plaster casts, electrotype reproductions, and other works of design, and has grown into a collection spanning five millennia and six continents. The museum’s campus features two museum buildings: the Main Building, designed by Cass Gilbert and first opened in 1904 as the Fine Arts Palace for the St. Louis World’s Fair; and the East Building, designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Sir David Chipperfield and opened in 2013. The campus also includes the Grace Taylor Broughton Sculpture Garden, which opened in 2015 and was designed by Michel Desvigne. 

Today, the museum’s global collection includes more than 34,000 objects, with 7,000 available for online discovery. The permanent collection features objects from numerous cultures, including North and South America, Africa, Oceania, Europe, and the Islamic world. The Saint Louis Art Museum houses the world’s largest collection of the work of Max Beckmann, and has permanent collection strengths in German Expressionist paintings, the arts of Oceania, ancient Chinese bronzes, and the work of Missouri artist, George Caleb Bingham.

SLAM supports a number of educational programs for families, teens, youth, adults, teachers, and students. Family programming includes weekly Family Sunday programs in the museum’s iconic Sculpture Hall, featuring guided tours for families. The museum regularly presents talks with artists, museum professionals, and academics that are open for community attendance. SLAM welcomes students with grade-appropriate, in-person, and virtual programming for students in 4th through 12th grade, with specific programs for 5th graders in the St. Louis Public Schools and other districts within the taxing district.

The museum’s Romare Bearden Graduate Museum Fellowship is nationally renowned as one of the oldest and most robust museum programs in the country dedicated to increasing diversity among professional staff in the Museum field. This paid, two-year fellowship critically prepares early-career museum professionals from historically underrepresented backgrounds for a career in art museums. The museum is continuing its leadership to diversify the museum field through the recently awarded Leadership in Art Museums (LAM) initiative. SLAM is one of 19 museums to receive this grant, adding two new positions in the registration department.

The museum’s 2023 exhibitions and installations include: Day & Dream in Germany, 1914-1945; Monet/Mitchell: Painting the French Landscape, organized by the Saint Louis Art Museum; and The Culture: Hip Hop and Contemporary Art in the 21st Century, co-organized by SLAM and the Baltimore Museum of Art. Additionally, SLAM showcased exhibitions from the Worcester Art Museum and its first exhibition to focus on modern Native American art from the IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts in Santa Fe. 

In June 2020, the Board of Commissioners directed three of its officers to examine what the museum was currently doing to heal racial disparities in the region and how this effort could be expanded. This initial study guides SLAM’s aspiration to become a national model for artistic ambition and excellence through inclusion of diversity in all forms, and these initiatives are regularly published on SLAM’s website.

SLAM is part of the Art Museum Subdistrict of the Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District of the City of St. Louis and County of St. Louis (ZMD), a political subdivision of the State of Missouri. The ZMD provides approximately 2/3 of the museum’s $40 million operating budget. SLAM is supported by a $250 million endowment.

SLAM is governed by a 10-member Board of Commissioners led by President Charles A. Lowenhaupt and a 72-member board of trustees led by President Bradford K. Werner, and Min Jung Kim serves as the Barbara B. Taylor Director. The Museum’s Friends Board, led by President Laura K. Sawyier, was formed in 1952 to create and support the membership program. This group of 45 volunteers continues to support the membership program and lead fundraising events.

Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (The Hewlett Foundation) is a nonpartisan, private charitable foundation that, for more than 50 years, has advanced ideas and supported institutions to promote a better world. The Hewlett Foundation supports efforts to advance education for all, preserve the environment, strengthen U.S. democracy, support vibrant performing arts, serve Bay Area communities, make the philanthropy sector more effective, and foster gender equity and responsive governance around the world. Additionally, the Hewlett Foundation also makes grants for special projects and to address other timely present-day problems, such as challenges related to cybersecurity. In 2020, the foundation announced a new grantmaking commitment focused on racial justice. 

Founded in 1966 by William and Flora Hewlett, the foundation’s approach and core areas of programming remain connected to the issues and principles of its founders. During its first decade, the Hewlett Foundation provided $15.3 million in grants to organizations in education, environment, health, performing arts, population, and vital services in the Bay Area. During a period of rapid growth in the 1990s, the foundation’s grantmaking budget grew from $35 million in 1993 to $84 million in 1998. The foundation’s efforts expanded, including scaling its environmental focus from California to the Western United States and Canada. Today, the Hewlett Foundation is one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the United States, awarding over $516 million in grants to organizations across the globe in 2021.

The Performing Arts Program supports meaningful artistic experiences for communities throughout the San Francisco Bay area by making grants that can make the most difference, particularly for those that have been overlooked and underfunded in the past. The program’s grantmaking embraces a range of aesthetic and artistic practices that give the Bay Area its unique character. Its work is guided by a strategic framework that focuses on Communities, Artists, and Youth, as well as four values that reflect the Hewlett Foundation’s guiding principles: the expansive power of the arts, community self-determination, equity and justice, and leadership. In addition, the program manages the $8 million Hewlett 50 Arts Commissions initiative launched in 2017 to celebrate the foundation’s 50th anniversary. 

In 2021, the Performing Arts Program awarded 92 grants totaling $22 million, and maintained relationships with more than 190 active grantees. Recent grants were awarded to Golden Thread Productions, Living Jazz, Joe Goode Performance Group, Social Good Fund for Peacock Rebellion, Youth Speaks, and Center for Cultural Innovation. Both the scale of the Hewlett Foundation’s funding and commitment to providing multiyear general operating support make it a key investor in Bay Area cultural life. In response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Performing Arts Program reduced reporting burdens for grantees, provided flexibility in how grant funds could be used, launched the Bay Area Crisis Navigator to share resources for arts workers and small enterprises in the region, and awarded an additional $17 million to 32 organizations 

The foundation has a 12-member Board of Directors led by Chair Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar and Larry D. Kramer serves as president. The staff of more than 120 are based in Menlo Park. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, The Hewlett Foundation reported assets of $14.8 billion, total reported revenue of $1.1 billion, and total reported expenses and disbursements of more than $617 million.

Museum Director - San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles,None,,"Organization

The San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles (Museum) is the first museum in the United States to focus exclusively on quilts and textiles as an art form and stands proudly in the worlds of both art and craft. The mission of the San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles is to preserve, celebrate, and promote knowledge about quilts and textiles, their creation, their beauty, and their relationship to human culture and expression.

Founded in 1977 and incorporated in 1991 as a 501c3, the Museum’s California-focused permanent collection comprises more than 1,400 objects, including historic and contemporary quilts, world textiles, and wearable art. The Museum has cultivated an environment that allows it to present makers both as finely skilled artisans and as professional contemporary artists who reflect on and display social matters within their work. Many of its exhibitions highlight the connection between fiber arts and current cultural, political, and environmental issues, such as Guns: Loaded Conversations,” (2018) an exploration of U.S. gun rights, violence, and history; and the upcoming Queer Threads, (2023) featuring contemporary works by U.S. LGBTQIA textile artists. Museum exhibitions, representing both local and world textile pieces and historic and contemporary art works, appeal to the diversity of Bay Area residents and tourists. 

The Museum is an anchor cultural institution in San Jose’s downtown South of Market Area (SoFA). Prior to pandemic closures, the Museum hosted 18 to 20 exhibitions annually, along with related workshops, lectures, panels, performances, docent-led tours, and other events.

Executive Director,None,,"Organization

Based in Massachusetts and serving the northeast region, the New England Museum Association (NEMA) connects a community steeped in learning, collaboration, and action to cultivate a better museum world. A world where all institutions consistently fulfill their potential for their stakeholders and society at large. NEMA creates opportunities for learning, personal growth, creative idea exchange, and inspiration that help individuals and institutions do their best.

NEMA can be traced back more than 100 years ago to the first “New England Conference” organized by Delia Isabel Griffin, founding director of the Boston Children’s Museum. Since then, NEMA has grown to become the country’s largest and one of the most active regional museum association with programs and services that extend beyond the region’s borders. NEMA hosts a variety of programs and events throughout the year, including networking receptions, educational webinars and workshops, roundtables with leaders, and the annual conference attended by an average of 800 museum professionals; where Publications, Excellence, and Lifetime Achievements Awards are given. Resources for the field include NEMA Marketplace, New England Museums Now (an online journal), NEMA jobs, Museum Document Exchange, NEMA 911, and Professional Affinity Gatherings. NEMA’s efforts also include a salary and benefits survey, advocacy through public policy, and work that addresses the relationship between the environmental crisis and the cultural sectors.

The NEMA Conference is one of the most significant annual museum community events for networking in the country. With over a hundred educational sessions, renowned keynote speakers, local off-site visits and evening events, the conference is NEMA’s second-largest operating revenue source after membership. NEMA’s network of memberships, over 2,600, includes museums of all scale and subject matter, other cultural institutions, individual museum staff persons and professionals, businesses who provide products and services to the museum field, and colleges and universities who educate museum professionals. Member benefits include admission to participating regional museums, discounts for insurance plans, access to NEMA publications, professional networking and professional development, award competitions, and numerous professional resources, including an online forum and an annual conference.

Over the past two years, the NEMA board and staff have engaged in intensive organizational reflection and training on issues relating to diversity, equity, access, inclusion, and justice (DEAIJ). NEMA recently announced its revised mission and value statements, along with a long-term strategic focus that centers equity and justice. New leadership will be key to implementing this ambitious and important strategy at all levels of NEMA’s operations. 

Central to the new mission, are six core values: 

 NEMA exists to cultivate a better museum world. 

 NEMA believes that all people should be treated equitably, and that equity centers on changing the museum structures that are systemically oppressive. 

 NEMA believes in expanding and enriching the diversity and interconnectedness of the museum field. 

 NEMA believes that the existential threat of the global environmental crisis poses unprecedented risk to museums, historic resources, and belongings of cultural value, requiring immediate sector-wide action. 

 NEMA believes in anticipating, assessing, and fulfilling the evolving needs of our museum community. 

 NEMA believes that the people, stories, collections, and experiences that enliven museums have the ability to create a more just society. 

NEMA has a physical office in Arlington, Massachusetts with four full-time members, including a Director of Administration, a Director of Programs and Advocacy, a Director of Membership and Development, and a part-time administrator. NEMA has a 15-member board of directors led by President Raney Bench. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, NEMA reported a total revenue of $437,217, with $256,234 in contributions and grants, $146,712 from program services, and $34,039 from other investment income. Total expenses were $391,409. 

NEMA recognizes that the organization and those of its members were founded within a colonizing society that continues the exclusion and erasure of many Indigenous peoples throughout New England and beyond.

Director and Chief Executive Officer,09/04/2024 23:59,,"Search for the Robert and Mercedes Eichholz Director and Chief Executive Officer

Santa Barbara Museum of Art

Santa Barbara, CA

The Santa Barbara Museum of Art (SBMA) seeks a collaborative, dynamic partner and servant leader to serve as its next Robert and Mercedes Eichholz Director and Chief Executive Officer (Director). Working closely with staff and reporting to the Board of Trustees, the Director will expand beyond SBMA’s mission to “integrate art into the lives of people” and will use its art and resources to enrich and transform those lives, in Santa Barbara and beyond.

SBMA opened to the public in 1941 in a building that served as the Santa Barbara Post Office from 1912 to 1932. As one of the leading art museums on the West Coast, the SBMA collection comprises over 25,000 works of art spanning over 5,000 years of human creativity. The thriving institution originates exhibitions that travel to museums worldwide, hosts world-renowned exhibitions, and offers a wide array of educational and interpretive programs. The impressive collection and programming at SBMA serve a broad audience of 150,000 annual visitors.

The Director will join a dedicated team tasked with ensuring that SBMA is both an engaged central forum for the artistic and collective community of Santa Barbara, as well as a destination museum for national and global audiences. Poised for its next great chapter, SBMA recently completed an enormously successful $50M renovation of its original 1912 building under the leadership of the current Director, Larry J. Feinberg. This project improved and expanded exhibition space for the permanent collection, created new gallery space for contemporary art, photography, and new media, and enhanced the overall visit experience and flow through the Museum. This project also addressed critically important structural aspects of SBMA’s physical health; seismic retrofitting; replacement of mechanical, air handling, and climate control systems; replacement of aging roofs; improved ventilation; creation of new storage and conservation areas; and construction of a new art receiving facility and loading dock. Building upon this structure and bolstered stability, the foundation of SBMA is primed to serve as a springboard for enhanced impact and engagement.

The next Director will build on this foundation to ensure the continued financial and creative success of SBMA while building deeper connections between SBMA and the community. There is immense opportunity for continuation and expansion of educational and community programming that embraces and celebrates the deep diversity of a county and region that is 47% Latinx in addition to the full spectrum of diversity in other forms. Within this community there is great potential to engage a deeply philanthropic population that is eager to support SBMA’s invigorated path forward. Serving as an empathetic and accessible leader, the Director will also be a champion for staff at all levels and empower the full team to maximize their collaborative potential. Each of these priorities cannot be fulfilled without an abiding commitment to and thorough application of SBMA’s values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and access within all functions of the Director role and stewardship of SBMA. With a commitment to world-class artistic excellence and to activating SBMA as a leading, shared resource for the rich, diverse community in Santa Barbara, the Director will guide SBMA in articulating and executing its next bold, compelling vision.

The Santa Barbara Museum of Art has retained Isaacson, Miller, a national executive search firm, to assist in the recruitment of the next Robert and Mercedes Eichholz Director and Chief Executive Officer. This a permanent, full-time position in Santa Barbara with a starting salary range beginning at $250,000.

Founded in 1933 as the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences, the Museum has more than 30,000 objects in its collection. In 1971, Walter P. Chrysler, Jr. initiated a gift that eventually totaled almost 25,000 works of art to the Museum, which was then renamed in his honor. From Ancient Egypt to cutting-edge contemporary figures, the Museum’s collection rivals that of any American museum and is notable for its glass collection, European and American painting, contemporary art, and photography. The glass collection is one of the most comprehensive in the world. The modern collection features artists, such as O’Keeffe, Pollock, Rothko, Lichtenstein, and Frankenthaler. The burgeoning photography collection includes more than 5,000 examples from the Civil War era to the present day. 

The Museum is home to the Perry Glass Studio, a dynamic and nationally recognized space for glass-making instruction. A major expansion is currently under way and will triple the size of the facility by the end of 2024. Classes and workshops are available for beginning, intermediate, and advanced students and include glassblowing, sculpted beads, patterned panels, stained glass, and glass sculpting. The Studio also offers college credit courses through several local institutions of higher learning.

The Museum offers a variety of educational opportunities for kids and families, teachers and students, colleges, and life-long learners. Children and families can participate in art camps and home art activities. Professional development and educational resources are available for classroom teachers. The Museum features lectures and events for the community, as well as free admission to the Museum for all visitors.

The Museum’s 2023 exhibitions include: Barbara Earl Thomas: The Illuminated Body, a meditation on the body as it exists in a world of light and shadow; Facing Ourselves: Mike Disfarmer and the American Portrait, an exploration of the relationship between photographer and subject; Raven and the Box of Daylight, featuring the work of internationally acclaimed glass artist Preston Singletary. Over the past several years, the Museum has organized major traveling exhibitions such as Black Orpheus: Jacob Lawrence and the Mbari Club, Americans in Spain, and Alma Thomas, Everything is Beautiful, that have garnered significant critical acclaim.

The Museum has a 28-member board of trustees led by Chairman Wayne Wilbanks, and Erik Neil serves as the Macon and Joan Brock Director and CEO. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, the Museum reported a total operating revenue of $9.5 million with $2.3 million from membership, contributions, and grants.

Fifty-five years after its founding, the 10th largest modern contemporary dance company in the nation remains rooted in the African-American experience and committed to the development of diverse movement artists on the global stage.

Through her training she met famed teachers Martha Graham, José Limón, George Balanchine, and James Truitte and performed with Dayton Ballet, Antioch Summer Theatre, and the Connecticut College Dance Theatre Workshop. At age 19, Blunden led the dance school at Linden Center, founded by the Schwarz sisters, before establishing DCDC in 1968.

DCDC has historically reached nearly 30,000 K-12 students annually through its educational and outreach programming. DCDC offers a wide variety of grade-appropriate performances and experiential learning opportunities for young people, including performances and workshops that highlight issues of identity and social justice, culture, and self-expression. Classes in modern dance, jazz dance, and ballet are taught through a partnership with Jeraldyne’s School of Dance.

CAA honors human diversity and acknowledges the extraordinary range of backgrounds, cultures, perspectives, work styles, education, rank, skills, and experiences that make the advancement of art and design integral to culture.

Of paramount importance to CAA is the promotion of inclusion, diversity, equity, and access within the fields of art, art history, and design.

CAA defines inclusion as a collaborative work-in-progress. It encourages all CAA constituents to embrace and adopt the ongoing practice of inclusion while advancing art, design, and their histories.

CAA also publishes four scholarly journals in art and art history—The Art Bulletin, Art Journal, Art Journal Open, and caa.reviews—as well as a weekly email newsletter. In addition, CAA provides grants to subsidize the publication of scholarly manuscripts in art, art history, and visual studies.

Over the past two years CAA has worked to build a stronger community and lay the framework for long-term sustainability. A six-year strategic plan was launched in 2020 aligned with five fundamentals to create a long-term sustainable business model for the association. It includes a multifaceted development function and an emphasis on utilizing digital-first technologies to provide value to an expanded membership by championing access, inclusivity, and diversity.

Born in 1947 in Queens and raised by immigrant parents from China, Corky taught himself photography, and strived to capture the underrepresented and largely ignored world of Americans of Asian descent.

Corky documented a range of subjects from the everyday life of residents on the Lower East Side, shop owners at work, to major historical movements, such as protests during the height of the civil rights movement in the 1970s in Chinatown. His recreation of the historic photograph commemorating the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, but, in his version, including Asian faces, is among his notable works. Beyond his photography, he worked as a community organizer and a mentor to many generations of Asian American students and fellow activists.

Artistic Director - Dayton Ballet,None,,"Organization

Founded in 1937, the Dayton Ballet is the second-oldest ballet company in the United States. Celebrating its 85th Anniversary season 2022-23, the Ballet produces four to five performances each season which highlight new, innovative works alongside ballet classics such as Cinderella, Romeo and Juliet, and Swan Lake. Dayton Ballet makes its home in the 1,139-seat Victoria Theatre and the 2,300-seat majestic Benjamin and Miriam Schuster Performing Arts Center.

In 2012, the Dayton Opera, Dayton Ballet, and Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra forged a groundbreaking and innovative merger into one organization, the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance (DPAA). The only merger of all three art forms in the nation, the DPAA serves the Dayton region as a single, integrated organization working together toward a shared purpose. That shared purpose is to inspire as many people as possible to fall in love with the performing arts. Its fundamental conviction is that the arts are for everyone. Dayton Ballet is crucial to achieving that shared purpose.

The 2022-2023 Dayton Ballet season features The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, The Nutcracker, a Diamond Anniversary celebration, and Peter Pan. The 2023-24 season will feature Dracula: Bloodlines, Swan Lake, Nutcracker, and a repertory show. While performances are the Ballet’s most high-profile events, the commitment to dance education, training, and outreach remains central to the organization and allows the Ballet to develop future audiences. Before there was the Dayton Ballet, there was the Dayton Ballet School, founded in 1927 by sisters Josephine and Hermene Schwarz. Presently, there are 200 students and includes Dayton Ballet II, a pre-professional training and performance company with senior and junior levels. Dayton Ballet has a long-standing association with Wright State University Dance Department. In addition, through the generosity of a sponsor, the DPAA offers five-dollar tickets to almost every performance, a program that has yielded substantially younger and more diverse audiences for all three art forms. Special funding provides free access to ballet classes for children from lower-income families and military families. In total, all performances through the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance reach an audience of more than 90,000 people in peak years, and the rich arts education programming serves over 65,000 schoolchildren in 150 schools in southwest Ohio. 

The DPAA has a 31-member board of trustees led by Chair Ed Tomme, and Patrick J. Nugent serves as President and CEO. For the year ending June 30, 2022, the DPAA reported a total revenue of $8.4 million, with $6.6 million from contributions and grants (including federal recovery aid) and $1.7 million from program services. Total expenses were $7.4 million. The 2023-2024 budget is projected to have $8.4 million in expenses and revenues. The Dayton Ballet has nineteen professional dancers and an artistic budget of $1.3 million. In the fall of 2022, ballet audiences returned in record numbers, selling out three performances of a brand-new Halloween-themed story ballet and setting all-time revenue records for the Nutcracker.

The Dayton Contemporary Dance Company which celebrates dance rooted in the African-American experience, and The Human Race Theatre Company are both led entirely by women. The four seasons of Dayton offer residents and visitors the opportunity to enjoy the 14,000 acres and 25 different facilities of Five Rivers Metro Parks year-round through educational programming. The region boasts the largest network of paved bicycle trails in the nation, over 300 miles’ worth. Sports enthusiasts can enjoy baseball with the Dayton Dragons, Gem City Roller Derby, and seven golf courses. 

Dayton sits in close proximity to 19 institutions of higher education. Wright State University (with its Raiders basketball team) and the University of Dayton (with the Dayton Flyers basketball team) Sinclair College are the closest. Central State University and Wilberforce University, both historically black institutions, are nearby and have partnerships with DPAA. Ranking 19th for access to healthcare, Dayton is also home to Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine and three major health systems. Montgomery County encompasses 16 public school districts with 56 private schools and 22 public charter schools in Dayton and 27 public schools in the city serving more than 29,000 students.

Over the past several years, MPAC has strategically focused on adapting its business model to fully support its vision of serving as an anchor institution for arts and culture in the region. 

Community

Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee is located along the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan. The city sits on traditional Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, and Menominee homeland along the southwest shores of Michigami, where the Milwaukee, Menominee and Kinnickinnic rivers meet and the people of Wisconsin’s sovereign Anishinaabe, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Oneida, and Mohican nations remain present. Milwaukee is a major league city—the business, cultural, sports, and technical base of a four-county metropolitan market of 1.5 million people, makes it the nation’s 39th largest metro area with a cost of living that is 15% below the national average. Known as a “big city of little neighborhoods,” Milwaukee’s East Side, Historic Third Ward, and Bay View are just a few of its great locales, each with its own unique personality. The downtown is undergoing an urban renaissance offering rich cultural diversity with mixed-use areas that are simultaneously historic and hip.

Milwaukee is at the center of a seven-county metropolitan area with a robust economy, ranked in the top 20 on MarketWatch’s 50 best United States metropolitan areas for business and one of the 25 best places for doing business by Inc. magazine. Seven Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the region, including Northwestern Mutual, ManpowerGroup, Kohl’s, and Harley-Davidson. Higher education institutions based in the city include the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, Milwaukee School of Engineering, and Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design. Milwaukee also offers extensive options for public transportation, including streetcar, bus, and commuter rail networks. General Mitchell International Airport is the largest airport in the Wisconsin region, offering nonstop flights to more than 35 destinations coast-to-coast and more than 200 international destinations with just one connection.

Recreation and leisure activities abound in Milwaukee. The city’s park system is ranked among the top 30 in the United States by the Trust for Public Land, with 90% of city’s residents living within a 10-minute walk to a park. The Oak Leaf Trail has more than 125 miles of trail for cycling, rollerblading, walking, birding, and running around Milwaukee County. Sports fans can catch the MLB Brewers at American Family Field, considered one of the best ballparks in America. Home to NBA Finals champions the Milwaukee Bucks, Fiserv Forum is a 17,500-seat arena and a world-class venue for large national and international entertainment artists. The city has a vibrant food and drink scene, with many modern craft breweries that maintain the city’s historic and cultural ties to beer. 

The city’s climate is typical of the Midwest, with four distinct seasons. Winters are snowy and cold and summers are pleasant and warm. Milwaukee is located two hours south of Green Bay, Wisconsin, home of the Green Bay Packers and Door County, which is a scenic getaway destination located on Lake Michigan. It is also located 90 minutes north of Chicago, the fourth largest city in the United States.

Milwaukee’s cultural vitality is a major factor in the region’s quality of life, with both nationally acclaimed anchor institutions and a growing cadre of emerging and mid-size organizations that reflect the city’s diversity and cultural heritages. The Milwaukee Art Museum, an architectural landmark designed by Santiago Calatrava, is one of the city’s most iconic buildings. The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra has restored and renovated the historic Warner Grand Theater as its permanent home, and the Milwaukee Public Museum will develop a new facility for its expansive natural history collections and interpretive programs. The Milwaukee Youth Arts Center houses the biggest children’s theater company and youth symphony orchestra in the nation. Supporting this stellar arts scene is the United Performing Arts Fund, established in 1967 to raise funds collectively for the performing arts sector.

Call for Participants: “Anonymous Was the Data”,None,,"The Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab at Princeton University hosts an art project directed by Artist-in-Residence, Chanika Svetvilas that launches Fall 2022. “Anonymous was the Data” looks at mental health and healthcare needs of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). It does this through a voluntary survey of AAPI who acknowledge within themselves a mental health difference. The survey questions explore the relationship between mental health difference and healthcare access. Suicide is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans ages 15-24 and Asian American women ages 64+. Racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination can have traumatic impact from generation to generation. Systemic barriers can include lack of access to health insurance and money for co-pays, lack of transportation, and lack of healthcare providers that understand their experience. Each data set collected from the survey will be mapped onto a physical characteristic such as a bubble or twist, which will then, using a 3D printer, be digitized to print as distorted prescription bottles. Collectively, these pieces will fit together as a puzzle and will be available for participants to assemble.“The goal of Anonymous was the Data is for the audience to see mental health data in a new way and apply the information to their locality and personal experience.” 

The data collected is individualized and handled with care and resources of support instead of generic clinical statistics. Svetvilas is working with an advisory committee and research associates at the Ida B. Wells Lab. The project will culminate with an interactive installation at the Lewis Center for the Arts, Princeton University in September 2023 and will include a workshop, artist talk, and panel discussion.

Director of Development - Folger Shakespeare Library,None,,"Organization

A hub for scholarship, performance, and the study of the early modern period, the Folger Shakespeare Library (Folger) puts Shakespeare and the period in which he lived in dialogue with a changing world. In advancing its mission, the Folger connects with 21stcentury audiences through programming and research inspired by a renowned collection of rare books, manuscripts, and other materials. The Folger creates lovers of Shakespeare and the humanities through programs that speak directly and powerfully to the human experience. Driving discovery and creating transformative experiences for students of all ages, the Folger is a leader in performance-based education, and more than two million teachers and students benefit from its broad variety of programs, exhibits, and events each year.

The Folger’s founders, Henry Clay and Emily Jordan Folger established the institution in 1932. The Folger is a world-class research center on Shakespeare and the early modern western world. The historic landmark building, designed in 1932 by Paul Cret, is undergoing a multiyear, $80-million-dollar renovation expanding public space, improving accessibility, and enhancing engagement for all visitors including a 12,000 square-foot New Pavilion that will feature new exhibition space and visitor amenities. The expanded Folger building promises a dramatically different relationship with new and existing audiences: teachers/educators, families, daytime visitors, members, academics, researchers, and scholars, general enthusiasts, and local/national/global institutional partners and funders. 

The transition to a more public-facing Folger has been ongoing for several years, and new development, communications and marketing strategies will be implemented during the renovation, scheduled to complete in fall 2023. The Folger is currently working with branding agency Truth & Consequences to develop a communication and marketing campaign specifically aimed at reopening visitation. The success of the campaign to support the renovation of The Folger is a catalyst for the next generation of board, donor, and membership support. 

Located one block from the United States Capitol Building in Washington, DC, the Folger is administered by a 22-member Board of Governors led by Chair D. Jarrett Arp, under the auspices of founder Henry Clay Folger’s alma mater, Amherst College. Director Dr. Michael Witmore leads a staff of 130 employees. For the fiscal year ending July 31, 2022, the Folger reported total revenue of $19.3 million and total expenses of $19.2 million.

Director - Center for Creative Photography,None,,"Organization

The Center for Creative Photography (CCP/The Center) at the University of Arizona (Tucson) is the premier research collection of American photographic fine art and archives, promoting creative inquiry, dialogue, and appreciation of photography’s enduring cultural influence. Established in 1975, CCP’s collections include some of the most recognizable names in 20th-century North American photography: Ansel Adams, Richard Avedon, Louis Carlos Bernal, Benjamen Chinn, Aaron Siskind, W. Eugene Smith, Lola Álvarez Bravo, Edward Weston, and Garry Winogrand. CCP’s collections, combined with its experienced staff, provide an unparalleled resource for students, educators, scholars, museums, publishers, and the public. Located on the University of Arizona campus, CCP’s public galleries, auditorium, print viewing room, research study center, conservation laboratory, and ancillary facilities support an active program of academic engagement, interdisciplinary research, community collaboration, preservation, exhibitions, publications, and loans to museums worldwide. CCP, with a designated gallery, partners with the Phoenix Art Museum and has a loan program with other venues worldwide to present CCP’s vibrant photography works to the broader community.

CCP has a large interdisciplinary research collection—which includes an archive of nearly 300 collections and a fine print collection numbering about 100,000 prints supported by a reference library—and an oral history collection. These works can be referenced in person and through various digital means. The Center is actively working on programmatic and user-driven digitization efforts and a technology plan which will serve to increase the accessibility of the collections. There are over 8 million objects in CCP’s archival collections, including photographic materials, letters, manuscripts, publications, unique artifacts, oral histories, and audiovisual recordings (available digitally through the Center’s Aviary instance). CCP also maintains an ArchivesSpace Instance which serves to describe the creation, content, context, and arrangement of the archival collection materials, enabling users to identify and request materials relevant to their research. For the fine print collection, a related platform CollectionsSpace is currently being implemented to provide similar digital services for the fine print collection which began at the institution’s founding, in part by a gift of the personal collections of the five founding archive artists and has continued to grow.

CCP is part of Arizona Arts, a university division that presents a unified gateway to the unique visual and performing arts assets, experiences, and educational programs, including the College of Fine Arts, on the University of Arizona campus.
